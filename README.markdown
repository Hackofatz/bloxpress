DESCRIPTION:
------------

THIS IS ALPHA!! - I never really finished this fork, but i will now.

Bloxpress allows you and your visitors to modify the layout of 
your Wordpress powered weblog. You can add any widget to one of 
the three predefined columns (sidebars) and begin to rearrange
these with drag and drop. Every change you make is stored in
a cookie on your computer, so you will not loose your personal
layout. 


INSTALLATION:
-------------

	cd wordpress/wp-content/themes/
	git clone git://github.com/m3nt0r/bloxpress.git
	
Then go to your admin panel and activate it.
